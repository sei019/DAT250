#Report
I had no issues during the assignment that I did not resolve.

##Finishing MongoDB
I finished the mongoDB introduction and tutorial and had no issues with this. The guide was simple and comprehensive.

##Installing MongoDB
The installation of MongoDB for Windows went without any issues, and I made sure to validate the package before installation (see verify.png). The associated Mongo shell was downloaded as part of the package.

##Experiment 1: Mongo CRUD operations
Create documents: No issues. See create-documents.jpg
Query documents: Went well. Some documents were "duplicated" from the previous creation of documents. See query-documents.jpg
Update database: I started by removing all existing documents, to avoid the triple duplication. No issues. See update-documents.jpg
Bulk queries: I executed the bulk query without adding the documents that were specified to be in the database already. This did not result in an exception but did not return the exact return values specified on the page. See bulk-queries.jpg.


##Experiment 2: Aggregation
Example: see aggregation.jpg

My function: see my-func.jpg.
The function is useful in interpreting the collection obtained because it shows what items each person has in their cart.
